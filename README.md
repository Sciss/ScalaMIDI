## linking

To link to this library:

    libraryDependencies += "de.sciss" %% "scalamidi" % v

The current version `v` is `"0.1.+"`

## building

ScalaMIDI currently builds against Scala 2.10, using sbt 0.12. It uses the MIDI API from Java (`javax.sound.midi`) under the hood.

## overview

Example:

```scala

    import de.sciss.midi._

    val sq  = Sequence.read("vexation.mid")
    val pl  = Sequencer.open()
    pl.play(sq)
    pl.stop()
    val t   = sq.tracks(1)  // second of three tracks
    val ev  = t.events      // all events in that track
    val pch = ev.collect { case Event(_, NoteOn(_, pch, _)) => pch }  // pitches
    pch.map(_ % 12).toSet.toList.sorted // pitch classes (all twelve!)
```
